# Face Recognition Attendance System
This project is a Face Recognition Attendance System built using OpenCV, Face Recognition, MTCNN, and Tkinter. It allows you to register individuals using their faces, track check-ins and check-outs, and calculate attendance percentages based on daily attendance.

## Features
- **Face Registration:** Capture and register individuals by their face using the webcam.
- **Face Recognition:** Detect and recognize registered faces in real-time and automatically mark their attendance.
- **Check-In & Check-Out:** Allows users to check-in when recognized, and check-out when prompted.
- **Attendance Tracking:** The system tracks check-in time, check-out time, time spent, and calculates attendance percentages.
- **GUI Interface:** Built with Tkinter, providing an easy-to-use graphical interface for interacting with the system.

## Requirements
Before running the project, make sure you have the following libraries installed:
- **opencv-python** (for video capture and processing)
- **face_recognition** (for face encoding and recognition)
- **mtcnn** (for MTCNN face detection)
- **pandas** (for storing attendance data)
- **tkinter** (for the GUI interface)
- **Pillow** (for image handling with Tkinter)

## You can install them using pip:
``` function test(){
console.log("pip install opencv-python face_recognition mtcnn pandas pillow");
}
```
