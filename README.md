# Face Recognition Attendance System
This project is a Face Recognition Attendance System built using OpenCV, Face Recognition, MTCNN, and Tkinter. It allows you to register individuals using their faces, track check-ins and check-outs, and calculate attendance percentages based on daily attendance.

## Features
- Face Registration: Capture and register individuals by their face using the webcam.
- Face Recognition: Detect and recognize registered faces in real-time and automatically mark their attendance.
- Check-In & Check-Out: Allows users to check-in when recognized, and check-out when prompted.
- Attendance Tracking: The system tracks check-in time, check-out time, time spent, and calculates attendance percentages.
- GUI Interface: Built with Tkinter, providing an easy-to-use graphical interface for interacting with the system.
